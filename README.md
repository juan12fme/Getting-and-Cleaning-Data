# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

1. The current repository is a submission from Juan Medina. It has the instructions on how to run analysis on Human Activity recognition dataset.

2. Dataset was original obtained from the following page: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#

3. CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations of the work made to clean and arrange all the data. 

4. FunctionToCleanAndArrangeData.R performs the data preparation and the following tasks required by the course:
  4.1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  4.2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  4.3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4.4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  4.5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

5. FinalData.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above.
